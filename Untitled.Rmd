This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1), mpg = c(2,1,0), cex = 0.8)
plot(cars, pch = 20, col = "darkgray")
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```
